# 1. LucidChart
LucidChart is a cloud-based software that allows the user to create flowcharts for programming, business operations, etc. Today I used LucidChart to create a flowchart for a simple program that tells the user if their input was greater than or less than 15 by saying "Big" or "Small," respectively. LucidChart is incredibly user friendly without sacrificing ability. I never felt lost while using the software and I plane to use it again in the future.

# 2. Introduction to Networking
### Data Transmission
* Packet - Unit of Data
* Packet Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
* IP Address - Unique identifying number
* DNS - Directory of IP address common names
* Protocal - Set of rules that allow devices to communicate

### Network Hardware
* A switch has the advantage of being able to send a packet to a specific device that is connected to the switch. This is impossible while using a hub because a hub broadcasts the packet to every device connected to it. This is beneficial because it doesn't waste bandwith and is much more secure.
* Hubs and switches can only communicate within a local area network (LAN), which means they cannot communicate with other **IP** addresses via the internet. This is the advantage that routers have over hubs and switches.

### Network Topologies
* Single Point failure - when the central hub/switch fails or a device fails. Wired topologies experience this such as: Star, Ring, or Bus.
* I like the wireless mesh architecture better as it seems much easier to set up.
