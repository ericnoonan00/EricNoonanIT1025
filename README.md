### Executive Summary
The purpose of IT1025 LabOne is to examine the history of computing and programming. Another one of its purposes is to get started and get familiar with GitHub. IT has an incredibly rich history with one of it's biggest highlights being the advent of programming. GitHub can be an invaluable resource for programmers and developers as it is an open source network of like minded programmers who share their work. It can also be quite useful for sorting, storing, and maintaining your repositories.

### Information System Components
A gas station is an information system people use millions of times a day
1. Hardware - The gas pump
2. Software - The software that computes the gas price/gallons of gas
3. Data - How much gas I bought and how much it costs
4. People - The gas station attendant who I handed a twenty dollar bill to
5. Process - The act of inserting my card, selecting the grade, pumping the gas, and collecting a receipt

### Client Server
A client server model can be described as a person with a computer accesing the info from a company/server remotely, almost like a library. People can leave their house and go to the library to access their public information.
Github is like this in the way that contributers post their work to this public *"library"* and people can access it from their PCs
___
### Cloud Computing
Github is an example of cloud computing because you can store your repositories on Github, not your local PC storage. A couple of others would be MEGA or MediaFire
___
### Conclusion
In conclusion, IT 1025 LabOne has taught me the ins and outs of GitHubs UI. It has also taught me about the advent of the computing age and how IT has impacted the world. I also learned about Information Systems and Cloud Computing. I expect to learn more about programming, programming languages and the differences/similarities between them. I am looking forward to using GitHub more and learning more about my passion.
