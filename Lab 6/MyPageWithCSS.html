            <p>HTML Links are used to send the user to a specific website. They come in handy for websites with many pages in that you are able to send the user to a different page with them. Also, links can be used to download something. A link is programmed using the &lt;a&gt; tag with the href attribute. Specific targets can also be attributed to the link such as a blank tab using the target attribute.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of each of these things.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A link from here to a different website. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_BLANK">here</a> in order to go to another website.</li>
                <li>A link which downloads someting would look like <span id="downloadExample">&lt;a href="file.png" <span id="download">download</span>&gt;</span></li>
                <li>Since I am unable to submit a screenshot of me making a link to a different page in this website, an example of which can be observed by going <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_BLANK">here</a> and clicking any of the buttons on the page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">Here</a> is a link to a page all about links.</p>
