### Internet Protocol
- An IP address is how another device identifies your network in order to send data packets. It is pretty much the same thing as an actual address. There are two types of IP addresses, IPv4 and IPv6. The difference is that IPv4 is written in decimal (base 10) IPv6 is written in hexadecimal (base 16). The IPv6 protocol allows for so many more unique IP addresses.
