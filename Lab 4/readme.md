The python IDLE shell give you an immmediate response to every single line of code you type into it. The text editor is where you can type out the entire program at once and it will run in the shell (or command prompt).
### i. A variable
Something programmers use to store a value. The author uses spam, bacon, and eggs as a reference to a skit by Monty Python, the namesake of the programming language.
### ii. An assignment statement
This is something like "spam = 15". We are assigning a value (15) to a variable (spam). This is what stores the value in a variable.
### iii. A function
A function is a command that makes action on some data such as a variable based on the funcntion name and whatever parameters you give the function
For Example:
  hello = 'hello world'
  print(hello)
The function is "print" and its making an action on the hello variable by outputing it.
### iv. The three data types
There are three data types. The first is a string which is a line of text enclosed by quotes (or apostrophes). The next would be an integer (abbreviated int) which is any whole number. The next is a floating point value (abbreviated float) which is a number that has a decimal.
