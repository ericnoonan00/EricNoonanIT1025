# Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 4 is to explore my current operating system and its terminal, explore and experiment with Python IDLE, and to explore different types of graphic types, image files and compression types. I look forward to exploring the terminal more and learning about images, as I am an artistic person.

# 2. Python IDLE
The python IDLE shell give you an immmediate response to every single line of code you type into it. The text editor is where you can type out the entire program at once and it will run in the shell (or command prompt).
### i. A variable
Something programmers use to store a value. The author uses spam, bacon, and eggs as a reference to a skit by Monty Python, the namesake of the programming language.
### ii. An assignment statement
This is something like "spam = 15". We are assigning a value (15) to a variable (spam). This is what stores the value in a variable.
### iii. A function
A function is a command that makes action on some data such as a variable based on the funcntion name and whatever parameters you give the function
For Example:
  hello = 'hello world'
  print(hello)
The function is "print" and its making an action on the hello variable by outputing it.
### iv. The three data types
There are three data types. The first is a string which is a line of text enclosed by quotes (or apostrophes). The next would be an integer (abbreviated int) which is any whole number. The next is a floating point value (abbreviated float) which is a number that has a decimal.

# 3. Graphics
### Raster vs Vector Graphics
Raster is the type of image that is composed entirely of millions of pixels. Vector describes the type of images that are formed using a special type of geometry. Raster graphics lose their image quality when they are zoomed in upon. Vector graphics do not suffer from this because of the way they are rendered.
### Lossless vs Lossy Compression
Lossy compression is a form of compression in which some of the data is removed from the file and thus the image quality is reduced slightly. Lossless compression is a form of compression in which none of the original data is thrown away. Each has their own advantages. For example, lossy compression is good for programs that have a lot of files, while lossless compresion is good for simple graphical files.
### File Formats: PNG, JPEG, & GIF
###### GIF
<ul>
  <li>allows for animation of image, something that the other formats do not allow for</li>
  <li>uses 8 bits per pixel which is only 256 RBG colors making it sub optimal for color complexity</li>
</ul>

###### JPEG
<ul>
  <li>because JPEG uses lossy compression, it's prone to artifacting</li>
  <li>allows the user to control the amount of comporession that is used in the image file</li>
</ul>

###### PNG
<ul>
  <li>uses lossless data compression</li>
  <li>now supported properly by every major browser</li>
  <li>PNG files support palette-based color (either 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA), greyscale, RGBA and RGB color spaces</li>
  <li>supports a number of transparency options</li>
</ul>

### File Properties
**i.** There were 9 layers in my project. I started off by making a rectangle for a background which I made my design on. Next, I made the big "E" and fit it to the center of the square. I used the text tool for this. Next, I made the words "Eric" and "Enterprise" using the big "E." Then, I searched through the different shapes i could make with the shape library on Vectr. I found the folder icon, which fits well with an IT enterprise. Finally, I drew out the DNA design in order to: fill up space left in between the "E" and the word "enterprise" and to relate it to making advancements in computer science. The double helix shape, being a relatively recent discovery, has an inspiring aura to it. This shape consisted of three vector paths.

**ii.** The size of my file was 70.3 KB and by default it opens with Chrome. A better option would be a dedicated graphical editor such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint.NET. These types of apps would be more appropriate because they are many times more powerful than Vectr and allow multitudes more options than Vectr. Also, when working on a more copmlex project, using a cloud-based graphical editor would not be convenient.

# Summary
Lab 4 taught me how to use the terminal to create and explore directories and how to find help in the Windows Command Prompt. It also taught me a little bit about how to use the Python IDLE terminal and how to write some code in Python. Python is a very unique programming language to me and I look forward to learning more about it. Finally, I learned the differences between the image files I see on a daily basis and what each one's advantages are. I never knew how a GIF animated itself before. I thought it was the same as an MP4 or MOV file, but really a gif is similar to those, except all the images are crammed into one file. An MP4 would be a <a href="https://blog.schoolspecialty.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Flipbook-Animation.gif">flipbook</a> while a GIF would be a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Prof._Stampfer%27s_Stroboscopische_Scheibe_No._X.gif/220px-Prof._Stampfer%27s_Stroboscopische_Scheibe_No._X.gif">stroboscope</a> animation.
