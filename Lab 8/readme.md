# Database
&tab;The diference between *data*,*information*, and *knowledge* can be looked at in tiers. Teir 1, *data* is pure quantitative and qualitative, devoid of context or intent. Tier 2, *information* is contextualized data. For example, monthly sales, calculated from daily sales, used to calculate yearly sales, are information. Tier 3 would be *knowledge*, which is human beliefs or perceptions about concepts local to the area of said human. There are two types of knowledge: *explicit* and *tacit* knowledge. *Explicit* knowledge refers to qualitative and quantitative knowledge - it can be expressed with words and numbers. *Tacit* knowledge refers to insights and institutions which are difficult to transfer into words.

**Making tables** - example: Small Company
- the Customer table and the Order table would have the primary key of *CustomerID* and *Order Number* respectively.
- The two tables are related by their primary keys. I made it this way because there would be no other unique way to keep track of the customers.
- CustomerID would be the foreign key to the Order table.

### Big Data
**The Four V's of Big Data**$NewLine;
- Volume: the amount of data that makes data *big*. It describes the entriety of the data that organizations have been trying to harness to improve decision making across the enterprise.
- Velocity: This represents the movement of data. Data movement is now almost real time and the update window has reduced to the fraction of a second. Because of this real-time nature of data creation, enterprises could incorporate streaming data into decision making.
- Variety: It defines different types of *data* and *resources*. New categories have been added to the list of data types.
- Veracity: The trustworthiness of the data and certain types of data.

**What types of technology have driven the increased need for big data?**
___
# Structured Query Language(SQL)
- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. If SQL is how you access, organize and update the database, RDBMS is how you make the database
- The two tables I picked were the product table and cataegory table. Their primary keys are ProductID and CategoryID. CategoryID is the foreign key to the product table. The category table is what holds a description of what type of product it is.
