___
# 1. Software
<ul>
  <li><strong>Operating Systems</strong> are the first things loaded when you boot up a computer and it: manages the hardware of a computer, provides the UI, and provides a platform for developing/using applications. All computers run on an Operating System. <strong>Application software</strong> is utilized directly today to accomplish a specific goal. These goals include word processing, calculations on a spreadsheet, or surfing the Internet using a browser. <strong>Utility software</strong> includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way. Things such as anti-malware programs are examples of utility software. These types of software are created to fill the shortcomings of an operating system.</li>
  <li><strong>ERP Software</strong> or <strong>Enterprise Resource Planning Software</strong> uses a database that most employees of a corporation can access. Also, software like this allows for a much more cohesive workforce. Examples of enterprise software include Oracle and </li>
  <li><strong>Virtualization</strong> allows a server to emulate hardware functionality using what's called a virtual machine. This allows the server to run numerous virtual machines at once; essentially, one machine can become multiple machines. </li>
</ul>

# 2. Virtualization
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problems Solved by Virtualization</strong>: 
     <ul>
       <li>Using 1 server for many tasks allows you to operate for cheaper than if you had 3 servers for 3 tasks</li>
       <li>You can now utilize servers to their full potential by allocating the unused server space for virtual machines</li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Hypervisors</strong> are a thin layer of software that unravel the mess of virual machines a server might have and put each of them in the hands of whoever might need them at a given moment.</li>
  <li>Option A: ***Still needs done***</li>
</ul>

___
# 3. Python
<ul>
  <li>Python's <strong>Pseudo-Code</strong> nature: Pseudo-Code is code that describes what a program is supposed to do or what a program is doing. When one codes with Python, you're focusing on the solution rather then focussing on the extreme syntax of a language like JavaScript or C++.</li>
  <li>A <strong>compiled</strong> language (i.e. C or C++) is translated from the source code into the binary, the computer's native language. On the other hand, an <strong>interpreted</strong> language is one that doesn't need compiled because it translates the source code into things called <strong>byte-codes</strong> (compact, numerical interpretations of a source code), which are then translated into the native language.</li>
  <li>Images of the Python console are linked.</li>
