# Executive Summary
In lab 3, we will define software types, practice working with virtualization and Python, and explore careers in information technology as well as co-ops, internships, certificates, certifications, industry association and student organization membership.  

___
# 1. Software
<ul>
  <li><strong>Operating Systems</strong> are the first things loaded when you boot up a computer and it: manages the hardware of a computer, provides the UI, and provides a platform for developing/using applications. All computers run on an Operating System. <strong>Application software</strong> is utilized directly today to accomplish a specific goal. These goals include word processing, calculations on a spreadsheet, or surfing the Internet using a browser. <strong>Utility software</strong> includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way. Things such as anti-malware programs are examples of utility software. These types of software are created to fill the shortcomings of an operating system.</li>
  <li><strong>ERP Software</strong> or <strong>Enterprise Resource Planning Software</strong> uses a database that most employees of a corporation can access. Also, software like this allows for a much more cohesive workforce. Examples of enterprise software include Oracle and </li>
  <li><strong>Virtualization</strong> allows a server to emulate hardware functionality using what's called a virtual machine. This allows the server to run numerous virtual machines at once; essentially, one machine can become multiple machines. </li>
</ul>

___
# 2. Virtualization
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problems Solved by Virtualization</strong>: 
     <ul>
       <li>Using 1 server for many tasks allows you to operate for cheaper than if you had 3 servers for 3 tasks</li>
       <li>You can now utilize servers to their full potential by allocating the unused server space for virtual machines</li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Hypervisors</strong> are a thin layer of software that unravel the mess of virual machines a server might have and put each of them in the hands of whoever might need them at a given moment.</li>
  <li>Option A: The difference between cloud computing and virtualization is virtualization allows you to create <i>simulated</i> environments, whereas cloud computing <i>is the environment</i> and one accesses that <i>real</i> environment remotely. In order for one to move from virtualization to cloud, one can create a cloud by pooling virtual resources together, organizing them using management and automation software, and creating a self-service portal for users.</li>
</ul>

___
# 3. Python
<ul>
  <li>Python's <strong>Pseudo-Code</strong> nature: Pseudo-Code is code that describes what a program is supposed to do or what a program is doing. When one codes with Python, you're focusing on the solution rather then focussing on the extreme syntax of a language like JavaScript or C++.</li>
  <li>A <strong>compiled</strong> language (i.e. C or C++) is translated from the source code into the binary, the computer's native language. On the other hand, an <strong>interpreted</strong> language is one that doesn't need compiled because it translates the source code into things called <strong>byte-codes</strong> (compact, numerical interpretations of a source code), which are then translated into the native language.</li>
  <li>Images of the Python console are linked.</li>
</ul>

___
# 4. Career Exploration
<h3>College Central</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>College Central</b> easily allows one to search for jobs and internships as well as keep their resumes organized. It has helpful advice for graduating and enrolled students for finding work and experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bureau of Labor Statistics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Web developers and digital interface designers; Associate’s degree; $60,000 to $79,999; No on-the-job training; Huge growth in the job market</li>
  <li>Computer systems analyst; Bachelor's degree; $90,000 median pay in 2019; No on-the-job training; Fast growth in this job market</li>
  <li>Database architects; Bachelor's degree; $93,000 median pay in 2019; No on-the-job training; Extreme growth in this job market</li>
  <li>Computer Network Architects; Bachelor's degree; $117,000 median pay in 2019; No on-the-job training; Average job groth</li>
</ul>
<h3>Certifications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CompTIA is a certification that applies an analytical approach to networks in order to prevent, detect, and combat cybersecurity threats.</li>
  <li>Cisco offers a a range of certifications. One can work their way up from an entry level certification, all the way up to a prestigious Expert or even Architect certification</li>
</ul>
<h3>Certificates</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Web Application Developement</strong>: a short-term certificate in which one explores current tech to develope web apps. Certificate is stackable with a Programming and Developement degree.</li></ul>
<h3>Internships and Co-Ops</h3>
In order to be co-op ready, one needs to:
<ul>
  <li>have completed 12 or more credit hours with at least two IT courses</li>
  <li>be currently enrolled in Tri-C</li>
  <li>have a GPA of 2.75 or higher</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industry Associations / Student orginizations</h3>
<p><strong>CCDC</strong> is a CyberSecurity club which hosts events where teams will compete to protect a network. Each team is given identical hardware/software and is scored based on how well they protect the business from threats that a neutral red team provides.</p>

# Conclusion
In Lab 3 we define software types, practiced working with virtualization and Python, explored careers in information technology, and looked atco-ops, internships, certificates, certifications, industry association and student organization membership. Before this lab, I had very minimal experience with python. I enjoyed learning about virtualization, how it works and the differences between it and cloud computing. I feel as if I have come closer to finding my passion in IT through this lab. On a final note, I also got to practice formatting using HTML in this lab.
